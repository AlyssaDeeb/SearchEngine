Information about the files everywhere

frequency.py should be run before index_construction.py


myinvertedindex.json
- this is a big boy
- the full index of form {"term": [[tf-idf, docID], ..., [tf-idf, docID]}

tf-idf/...
- this directory's structure is identical to /WEBPAGES_RAW
- for each document it holds a file tf_idf.json
- this document holds the tf_idf score for each term
- form of {"term" : tf-idf}

df_t_sorted.json
- the df_t.json file sorted by count
- this is not relevant for putting in the DB just for looking at the
- data

df_t.json
- holds the document frequency for each term
- stored in the form {"term" : count}


WEBPAGES_JSON/...
- this directory's structure is identical to /WEBPAGES_RAW
- for each document it holds two files:
    - 1. a json file holding the term frequency for this document
    -    form of: {"term": count}
    - 2. a json file (ending in _tf) holding the "weighted" term
    -    frequency (w_{t,d} = 1 + log tf_{t,d})
    -    for this document form of: {"term": count}

WEBPAGES_RAW/...
    - nothing new here, original input directory
